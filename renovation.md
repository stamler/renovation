1. Cut back the wall to the left of the existing fridge so that it is flush with the wall behind the fridge. Cut the existing flooring at the same point (in line with the back wall of the kitchen behind the fridge) This will be one extreme end of the renovation area. There is a switch on the section of the wall that will need to be moved further into the hall way. Add a second switch to control a pair of pendant lights that will hang over the island. Install two boxes in the ceiling for these lights. Power for these pendant lights can come from the existing overhead light in the kitchen so only switch wire needs to be installed.

2. Remove all cabinetry and the existing kitchen including the sink. Install new drywall in kitchen and prime it. Seal the walls to the floor. The corner cabinet to be installed on the wall covers the exhaust duct for the range. The [proposed cabinet is this one](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/assembly_instructions/sektion-corner-wall-cabinet-frame-white__AA-2246250-2-2.pdf). Determine what is required to prepare this cabinet so the duct work can travel through it toward the range. Make necessary cuts in the cabinet and install covers in the cabinet to protect the ductwork. If you are unable to use the spec'ed IKEA cabinet, build a replacement cabinet that will match.

3. To the left of the corner cabinet, build and install a custom wall cabinet and base cabinet to fill the gaps that exist in the 3D image of the proposed kitchen.

4. The dishwasher power source comes out of the floor and will need to be moved approximately 12" so that it comes up under the new island. A separate new circuit will need to be installed for the new dishwasher. The receptical in the island will be on the back of the island opposite the drawers which open into the kitchen.

5. There is already a power source for the fridge. The new kitchen design leaves 48" wide for counter-depth fridge and freezer (individual units). We will tentatively install this [fridge](https://www.canadianappliance.ca/product/LG_LRONC1404V_Column_Refrigerators_LG_LRONC1404V.html) and [freezer](https://www.canadianappliance.ca/product/LG_LROFC1104V_Upright_Freezers_LG_LROFC1104V.html). If the electrical code requires a separate recepticle for each, install a second outlet. Otherwise the existing one is fine.

6. Remove the walls forming the jacket closet adjacent the closet door. This will involve relocating a recepticle in the closet (put this in the back wall of the closet which will become an open wall). A custom cabinet will be created in this space with specifications to follow <TBD>. This cabinet will extend floor to ceiling. This will also involve relocating the intercom panel, the hallway light, and a light switch. We will remove the hallway light, attach the intercom to the side of the custom cabinet, and the light switch (which controls the dining room pendant light) will be moved wherever the contractor deems convenient and simple.

7. For the custom cabinet, the tenative plan is for 4 drawers in two rows at the bottom for boots and footwear, 14" (bottom) and 8" (top) tall on the inside. Above that a large void for hanging coats on hangers and a dowel. On top of that a 25" tall cabinet that extends the entire width with doors. The jackets void with hangers will have no doors. The electrical panel will open into the new custom cabinet so it no longer opens into the new bathroom. The approximate depth of the drawers and above-cabinet storage will be 22".

8. Change the electrical panel in the walk-in closet (which will become the new bathroom) to face the other way, now inside the custom jacket cabinet.

9. The hallway closet will be the location for the new hot water tank. It will also be tiled with the new kitchen flooring being used. A larger hot water tank will be installed to accomodate a large bathtub.

10. Cut the existing floor at least 156" from the back wall (behind the fridge) of the kitchen across the whole condo all the way to the closet door. If the frame of the closet door extends slightly beyond this, make the distance longer to accomodate. Also tile from the new jacket closet approx 49" out from the outside wall toward the far edge of the entrance door and extending 6-8" beyond the entrance door. This is the other extreme of the renovation area opposite that mentioned in (1). Remove all existing laminate flooring in this area, apply necessary surface preparation and install new tile in this area (including the hallway closet and the area where the jacket closet was removed), allowing penetrations for the power cable in the island and kitchen plumbing. The total amount of floor tile in the kitchen area is approximately 210 sq ft. with medium-dark grey, 12X24" matte tile (minimal variation in colour and texture) with light grey grout. 

11. Install a Corian counter top and a backsplash of 3" * 6" subway tile (regular, glossy white,no beval) with a light grey grout. Install matching Corian sides on the island, waterfall style.

## 2. Closet to Bathroom converion

1. A receptical will be installed in the common area opposite outside the condo on the wall shared with the new bathroom.
2. This will be a bathroom with a toilet, and a sink on a vanity and a tub/shower combination. If we're required to open the floor of the existing bathroom we will proceed with a full renovation of that bathroom as well.
3. We can open the wall of the closet and remove all the drywall if you'd like. We can take pictures to determine whether tearing up the floor in the existing bathroom is necessary. This may assist in planning and reduce costs.
4. A loose wire is in the ceiling of the existing bathroom running to a blank receptical in one of the bedrooms. This should be added to the electrical panel via the opening of the closed walls.
5. We would prefer a shower mixer like Grohe thermostatic mixers with a rainshower plus hand shower.
6. The bath area would be 3" x 6" subway tile in white with no bevel (like the kitchen back splash) with white epoxy grout. In the bath area, tile extends from bathtub to ceiling. This tile would then extend to the wall behind the sink and toilet, but only part way up the wall approximately 48" high. No tile on the wall opposite the sink/toilet or around the entry door.
7. We will specify a wall-hung vanity and sink from IKEA. [GODMORGON / ODENSVIK Bathroom vanity, 24” or 32” wide](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/godmorgon-odensvik-bathroom-vanity-brown-stained-ash-effect-dalskaer-faucet-s09305186/)
8. Floor tile, small, white, matte approx 1 inch hexagonal tile with dark grey grout.
9. Toilet to be determined.

## 3. Existing Bathroom renovation

***This will only be done if opening the wall in the closet to bathroom conversion reveals a requirement to open the floor in the existing bathroom***

1. Remove existing shower and cabinetry. Remove dividing wall between washing machine/dryer combo and counter. Re-drywall as necessary.
2. Shower/large soaker tub combo will replace the existing shower, with glass dividing walls. Install blue subway tile with white epoxy grout.
3. Tile flooring (large light grey 13X13 tile with medium grey grout).
4. Replace toilet with same as the closet bathroom.
5. To the left of the washer/dryer, a custom storage unite is needed, approximately 30” wide and 32” deep, which interior shelving.
6. Custom counter top (with 1 under mount sink) and cabinets below. Doors on cabinets light wood look, matching IKEA Askersund in the kitchen

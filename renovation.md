# Renovation

## 1. Kitchen

1. Cut back the wall to the left of the existing fridge so that it is flush with the wall behind the fridge. Cut the existing flooring at the same point (in line with the back wall of the kitchen behind the fridge) This will be one extreme end of the renovation area. There is a switch on the section of the wall that will need to be moved further into the hall way. Add a second switch to control a pair of pendant lights that will hang over the island. Power for these pendant lights can come from the existing overhead light in the kitchen so only switch wire needs to be installed.

2. Remove all cabinetry and the existing kitchen including the sink.

3. The dishwasher power source comes out of the floor and will need to be moved approximately 12" so that it comes up under the new island.

4. Remove the walls forming the jacket closet adjacent the closet door. This will involve relocating a recepticle in the closet (put this in the back wall of the closet which will become an open wall). A custom cabinet will be created in this space with specifications to follow. This cabinet will extend floor to ceiling. This will also involve relocating the intercom panel, the hallway light, and a light switch. We will remove the hallway light, attach the intercom to the side of the custom cabinet, and the light switch (which controls the dining room pendant light) will be moved wherever the contractor deems convenient and simple.

5. For the custom cabinet, the tenative plan is for 4 drawers in two rows at the bottom for boots and footwear, 14" (bottom) and 8" (top) tall on the inside. Above that a large void for hanging coats on hangers and a dowel. On top of that a 25" tall cabinet that extends the entire width with doors. The jackets void with hangers will have no doors. The electrical panel will open into the new custom cabinet so it no longer opens into the new bathroom.

5. The hallway closet will be the location for the new hot water tank. It will also be tiled with the new flooring being used. A larger hot water tank will be installed to accomodate a large bathtub.

6. Cut the existing floor at least 156" from the back wall (behind the fridge) of the kitchen across the whole condo all the way to the closet door. If the frame of the closet door extends slightly beyond this, make the distance longer to accomodate. This is the other extreme of the renovation area opposite that mentioned in (1). Remove all existing laminate flooring in this area, apply necessary surface preparation and install new tile in this area, allowing penetrations for the power cable in the island.

## 2. Closet to Bathroom converion

1. A receptical will be installed in the common area opposite the new bathroom and mounted
1. This will be a bathroom with a toilet, a sink and vanity, and 

## 3. Bathroom

* This will only be done if opening the wall in the closet to bathroom conversion reveals a requirement to open the floor in the existing bathroom *

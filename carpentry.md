# Custom Carpentry

## Kitchen

1. Cabinet over fridge/freezer area that matches the height of other cabinets and matches door appearance.
2. Custom cabinet to the right of fridge/frezer area both bottom and top to fill space with matching doors.
3. Dishwasher enclosure to support counter top, and attachment of cover panel.

## Closet to Bathroom conversion

1. New door that opens in to the bathroom and to the left with door stop
2. A custom vanity will be made by GG construction with the following specifications:
    * Wood: Walnut (aesthetic [like this model](https://teodorvanities.ca/collections/vanities/products/austin-24-teodor-modern-wall-mount-american-black-walnut-vanity-w-blumotion))
    * Goes to the floor with a toekick on the front but not the exposed side, which goes all the way to the floor (not wall hanging)
    * 3 drawers— the two smaller uppers with notches around drain pipe, one large one on the bottom
    * Since the vanity will be touching the wall on the right, the drawer will need to not extend all the way to the right.
    * 20” x 20” drawer top dimensions
    * Wall-mounted tap to reduce plumbing in the vanity. Fixtures chosen from PMF
